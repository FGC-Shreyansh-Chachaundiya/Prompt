As a seasoned software engineer, you have been assigned the crucial task of thoroughly analyzing the attached codebase. 
The primary objective is to ensure the RELIABILITY of the code, focusing on various key criteria to identify strengths and weaknesses.
Your role involves scrutinizing the codebase against specific resilience criteria. For each criterion listed below, 
perform the following steps:
1. Identify issues by providing snippets of the weak code.
2. Propose improved code snippets to address the identified weaknesses.

1. **Error Handling and Exception Management:**
2. **Robustness to External Changes:**
3. **Consistency in Data and State Management:**
4. **Resource Management:**­­­
5. **Testing and Coverage:**
6. **Failover and Redundancy Mechanisms:**
7. **Boundary Conditions:**
8. **Concurrency Control:**
9. **Recovery and Error Reporting:**
10. **Dependency Management:**
11. **Analyzability:**
12. **Modifiability:**
13. **Testability:**

The expected outcome is a comprehensive report detailing the strengths and weaknesses of the code, along with practical solutions. 
This report will serve as a guide for optimizing the RELIABILITY of the provided code. For each criterion, 
you should present both the snippets of weak code and the corresponding improved, 
more reliable code.Conclude your analysis with an overarching assessment of the code's overall RELIABILITY. 
Summarize the impact of the implemented changes on the codebase. 
Ensure that your insights not only identify problems but also offer actionable solutions in the form of code snippets.
 The final report will provide valuable insights to enhance the code's RELIABILITY step by step.

Provide the output in the following format:
<Factor Heading>
<Issue> with code snippet
<Solution> with code snippet
